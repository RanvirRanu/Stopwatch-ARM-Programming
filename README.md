This was developed from a lab in my ECE3375 class! 

It is a stopwatch designed for ARM Cortex A9 and Cyclone V FGPA, with the basic standard features of Stopping, Starting, A lap timer, and reset,

Honestly the C version of this code isn't particularly advanced or difficult, but I hope this shows I know how registers and timers work :)

I'm working on an assembly version of this, but no promises I remember to finish AND upload it to here.
